Animation of multislice:

autoslice can produce an animation (or movie) of the magnitude of the wave passing through the specimen.

1. First run autoslice in animation mode (one of the initial questions). This will produce a sequence of
image files slice00000.tif, slice00001.tif,... etc. for each slice. This may be slow and use a lot of
disk space.

2. Next run autoslicAnimate.py (in python) to read in these slice*.tif files and produce an animation.
This may also take significant computer time. All of the images in the series are displayed on the 
same scale so the intensity of different slices can be compared. It defaults to mp4 format (can be 
modified for .gif format). python actually uses Imagemagick which must also be installed. Imagemagick
include ffmpeg to actually calculate the mp4 mpeg animation.
 
Note: There is an assumption that the files are read in the correct order (slice00000.tif, slice00001.tif,etc)
which usually works but may not be guaranteed in all operating systems.
